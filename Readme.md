# Titanic : Kaggle Competition
#### __This project is currently a work in progress.__
------

## Steps

- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Engineering
- Model Building

In the data engineering and modeling phase, we create a pipeline to eventually perform gridsearchcv. This not only allows us to do custom transformations, but also, allows us to apply those transformations to make predictions on unseen data. 

## Initial Setup

1. Initial set-up involved setting up a virtual environment for this specific project. 
2. Code repository also includes a .bat file used to create the folder structure and intialize a git repository.
